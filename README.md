Key Features
Input Todo:
Users can enter new tasks through the provided form. After filling out the form, the entered tasks will be displayed in the browser console, allowing users to see all the tasks they have added.

Display and Mark Todo:
Each task entered will be displayed in the todo list section. Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking the checklist button. Once marked, the task will be removed from the active todo list.

Managing Completed Todos:
Completed tasks will be moved to a special section for completed todos. Users can delete completed tasks by clicking the trash button. Deleted tasks can be restored to the active todo list by clicking the undo button, allowing users to manage their tasks more flexibly.

After completing this project, I gained an understanding of the fundamentals of state management, event handling, and DOM manipulation. Additionally, I modified the code using Bootstrap, making this website interactive across various media. I am very excited to learn this material and look forward to my next project!

Curious? Give it a try!
